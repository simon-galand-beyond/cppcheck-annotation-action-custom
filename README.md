# CppCheck Annotation Action

![tests](https://github.com/Konstantin343/cppcheck-annotation-action/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)


Github action, which allows you to annotate C/C++ code in a pull request with warnings, errors, etc. from [cppcheck](https://github.com/danmar/cppcheck) static analysis tool.

## Usage

**Create `.github/workflows/cppcheck-annotaion`.**  
**Add default content to it:**
```yaml
name: cppcheck-annotations

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  build:
    name: cppcheck-annotations
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run cppcheck-annotation-action
        uses: Konstantin343/cppcheck-annotation-action@v1.0
        with:
          std: 'c++14'
          platform: 'unix64'
          log-level: 'verbose'

      - name: Annotate lines with errors
        uses: yuzutech/annotations-action@v0.4.0
        with:
          repo-token: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
          title: 'Results of CppCheck'
          input: 'annotations.json'
```

### Outputs

Generate file with name that passed as `json-results-file` in inputs.   
This file contains json object with **GitHub Checks** annotations in format described on https://docs.github.com/en/rest/checks/runs#create-a-check-run--parameters.  
Example:
```json
[
    {
    "title": "Division by zero.",
    "message": "Division by zero.",
    "annotation_level": "failure",
    "file": "tests/test.cpp",
    "line": 14,
    "start_column": 23,
    "end_column": 23
  },
  {
    "title": "Variable 'arr[10]' is assigned a value that is never used.",
    "message": "Variable 'arr[10]' is assigned a value that is never used.",
    "annotation_level": "warning",
    "file": "tests/test.cpp",
    "line": 14,
    "start_column": 13,
    "end_column": 13
